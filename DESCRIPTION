   'The repertoire of Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer' <doi:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3>. 
    Please see ?PCAWG7. The funny name
    comes from the fact that this paper was generated by

    (PCAWG) consortium. The signature profiles were later placed on the COSMIC
    web site and have been subsequently updated.
