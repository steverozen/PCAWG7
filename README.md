## Purpose

Contains data from The COSMIC web site
<https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures/index.tt> and from the
paper by Alexandrov, Kim, Haradhvala, Huang et al., ‘The repertoire of
Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer’. Please see `?PCAWG7`.
<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3>. The funny name comes from
the fact that this paper was generated by Working Group 7 of the Pan
Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. The data were then
placed on the COSMIC web site and subsequently updated.
