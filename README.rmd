## Purpose

Contains data from the paper by Alexandrov, Kim, Haradhvala, Huang et al., 'The
repertoire of Mutational Signatures in Human Cancer'
<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3>. Please see `?PCAWG7`.  The funny
name comes from the fact that this paper was generated by Working Group 7 of the
Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. The data were then
placed on the COSMIC web site and subsequently updated.
